                  The user can also define a point that they want the route to include or have the app calculate up to 3 shortest routes from point A to point B. 
                  <br>The app also contains a collection of landmarks present around Waterford City. The user can choose to pick the cheapest (shortest in kms) path between chosen landmarks. 
                  They can also choose the most historic path and a path that specifically avoids a certain landmark. The landmarks are all displayed in a TreeView object in the GUI.

                  It will then create sets and use these sets to draw boxes around the fruits on the image. By clicking on these fruits you can also view some basic stats about it. The app also has a

                Pokedex is a web app that lets you maintain your own pokemon collection. You can add different generations and inside the generations you can add specific pokemon 
                to keep your collection nice and organised. It allows you to specify the name, pokedex number, type, rarity and image of the pokemon and lets you edit these parameters at will.
                <br>The Home Page will show you your personal stats as well as some global stats that are based on the total number of generations and pokemon added by all users on the system.
                <br>The "Our Staff" page will display some information on a made up team behind the web page, an embedded google map pointing to the nintendo offices in Japan and 
                gives you the ability to leave comments that will be visible by all users.
